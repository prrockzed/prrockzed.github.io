Lots of things happened between the first two blogs. Which I couldn't write yesterday. So here it is.

<!-- truncate -->

Things like General Championship(Hall Level) in which i played Lawn TEnnis and i lost all of my games. Though i learned very much from them. As for an excuse as to why i lost all my matches is that i just learned tennis for a year maybe(and that too was not everyday or i had proper training) while all other guys had literally trainer for atleast 4-5 years.
