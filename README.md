## 🌐 My Portfolio Website

Welcome to the code repository for my personal portfolio website! This is where all the magic happens (or at least the organized chaos that looks like magic). 

The website is built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), the coolest static site generator in town. It's my online home, or rather we can say, this is the place where I dumped everything I got — in a curated professional way.

## 📊 About the Website
This portfolio website is my digital doppelgänger. It's packed with:

- **About Me**: A concise summary of who I am (no existential crises here).
- **Social Media**: Links to where I post updates, ideas, or cat memes (your call).
- **Education**: A snapshot of my academic journey, including my current stint at IIT Kharagpur.
- **Interests**: Things I’m passionate about—spoiler alert: it’s not just coding.
- **Positions of Responsibility**: My adventures in leadership within IIT Kharagpur societies.
- **Industrial Experience**: Cool stuff I’ve done in internships and projects.
- **Tech Stack**: Tools, languages, and frameworks I’ve tamed (or am still wrangling).
- **Achievements**: The brag-worthy moments that make me blush.
- **Blogs**: Where I pen down my thoughts on tech, life, and everything in between.
- **Resume**: A one-click shortcut to my professional story—your future employee of the month?

## 💪 Tech Stack
- **Frontend Framework**: [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) (because good-looking websites deserve it).
- **Hosting**: [Github](https://pages.github.com/) (or whatever hosting service my budget allowed).
- **Languages**: A spicy mix of JavaScript, React, and Markdown.
